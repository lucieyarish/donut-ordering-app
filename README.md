## Overview
This project was built while learning essential HTML, CSS and JavaScript concepts through Scrimba's [Frontend Career Path courses](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend). 

The Figma mockup was provided by Scrimba and redesigned by me. The app was originally supposed to be a Restaurant Ordering App, but students are always engouraged to change the theme and make it their own.

The app was built entirely from scratch by me.

### The Challenge
#### Basic Requirements
- Follow the design spec
- Render the menu options using JS
- Add items feature
- Remove items feature
- Have a payment modal with compulsory form inputs

#### Stretch Goals
- Offer a ‚Äúmeal deal‚Äù discount ‚Äî If food & drink are bought together, offer e.g. 15% discount
- Allow users to rate their experience (e.g. 1-5 clickable stars)
- Change the theme
